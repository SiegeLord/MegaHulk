# MegaHulk

# Plot

You are a robot that is sent to recover gifts from extraterrestial mines.

# Gameplay Hints

- Look at the controls menu for the controls!
- Look at the map if you're lost.
- You can maintain your kill stream by pressing the Enrage key at the cost of
  health!
- Hit the enemy center for more damage.

# Building instructions

1. Install Allegro 5.
2. Install Rust from rust-lang.org. You'll need the nightly version.
3. Run `cargo run --release` to build and run the game.

On Windows, you can use the pre-built binaries (extracted in the `allegro`
subdirectory). `run_msys.sh` may be useful for this purpose.
